Sayches requires advertisers to undergo a verification process to ensure a safe and trustworthy ad experience for users. This verification process helps us learn about our advertisers’ business, the products, and services they offer.


**Simple, Non-Intrusive Advertising Through Sayches**

The fundamental principle of Sayches is to protect our users’ privacy, so we do not use personal data for profiling, advertising, or within any intrusive model for personalised ads. Our advertising program simply provides a space for advertisers based on keywords that our users search.


**How Does Sayches’ Keyword System Work?**

Sayches uses keyword searches to drive our advertisement system, which means that a user who searches for a particular keyword will only see adverts based on that search. We will never show the user ads related to their past searches or any other form of behind-the-scenes segmentation. Every time somebody uses the services of Sayches, it will be as though they are using the platform for the first time.

Advertising through Sayches is easy – you can build awareness for your brand by targeting audiences based on keywords. Your advertisement may consist of text only or include graphical elements, depending on which plan you choose. Let’s take a look at the advertising plans that are offered:


**1. Segment**

The Segment plan is Sayches’ simplest form of advertisement, but also one of the most effective. It consists of a simple text-only advertisement, which is a great way to grab the attention of a portion of users who are searching for a particular keyword.


**2. Announcement**

The Announcement plan is similar to the Segment plan in that it is also text-only. However, these advertisements are unique in that they will appear as notifications or messages to a targeted list of user accounts.
 

**3. Flyer**

If you’re looking for the ultimate eye-catcher, Sayches’ Flyer advertisement plan is a solid option. They include both graphics and texts, providing an easy advertising solution for creating awareness.


**4. Promoted Accounts**

Your Promoted Account will feature in the ‘Suggestions For You’ section. This feature is based on a recommendation engine that identifies similar profiles to help users discover new businesses. These promote accounts can also be geo-targeted based on country to optimise the relevance of these advertisements.


**5. Promoted Posts in Feed**

You can also create promoted posts on Sayches to reach users whilst they search for relevant keywords on Sayches. Promoted posts will appear at the top of the search results page of these keywords. This ultimately allows you to amplify your messages and reach a wider audience. These posts can of course be targeted to individuals who search for keywords that are relevant to your brand, in addition to being geo-targeted to remain relevant to your country of choice.


**6. Market Research Solution**

You can also use Sayches’ advertisement space for conducting market research. These appear in the form of simple polls that allow users to provide you with answers to your questions, with results being processed in real-time.

Once your advertisement request has been approved, you will unlock a new section on your profile – Ads History. This allows you to gain insights on your ad performance based on automatically processed data, making it quick and easy to learn what works for you and improve your strategy.
